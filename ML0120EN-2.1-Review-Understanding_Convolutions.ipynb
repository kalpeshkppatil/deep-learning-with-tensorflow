    "This understanding of how convolutions work are the foundation of how Convolutional Neural Networks work. After this tutorial you are supposed to understand the underlying mathematical concepts and how to apply them using| Python (Numpy) and TensorFlow. The next step is to extrapolate this knowledge to Machine Learning applications.\n"
